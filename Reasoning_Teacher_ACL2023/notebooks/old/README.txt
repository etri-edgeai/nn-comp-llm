These notebooks were used to run and evaluate all experiments on our ACL initial submission.
The notebooks reference old code modules, so they will not run as is. However, they can be used as a reference for
experimental details (especially for analysis-related experiments).

"Data Preparation.ipynb" was used to preprocess the original datasets into the json files that go in `data/dataset/` (refer to main README for download links).
